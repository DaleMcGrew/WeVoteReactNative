# Running WeVoteReactNative for the First Time
[Go back to Readme Home](../../README.md)

Please make sure you have read:

* [Preparing the Environment on Your Machine](ENVIRONMENT.md)

* [Bringing Code to Your Machine](CLONING_CODE.md)

## iOS 

### Method 1 - Quick

    (WebAppEnv) $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/WeVoteReactNative
    (WebAppEnv) $ react-native run-ios

This opens the iOS simulator.

## Method 2 - Preferred

I recommend this method because then you have easier access to the XCode console log.

1. Open XCode.

2. From within XCode, open this project:


    /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/WeVoteReactNative/ios/WeVoteReactNative.xcodeproj

3. Click the "Play" (sideways triangle button), and this opens the iOS Simulator.
